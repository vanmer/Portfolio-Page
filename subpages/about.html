          <p>
            Hello fellow human beings! I'm a Graphic Designer and Front-End
            Developer living and working in Leipzig.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was born and raised in Munich and in 2016 I graduated from the
            Designschule München as a Staatlich geprüfter
            Kommunikationsdesigner.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the following month, I moved to Leipzig to study Philosophy at
            the Universität Leipzig.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the end of 2019 I changed my plans once again and started to
            transition to web, learning the fundamentals of Web Programming and
            UI/UX Design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was immediatley intrigued by the creativity and complexity of web
            technology and the challenging task of problem solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            My main object in web developement is to bring together pleasing
            aesthetic looks and functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Github, and
            npm. Currently, I am learning Sass and PHP.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of working life, I am passionate about skateboarding, an
            avid Ashtanga Yoga practitioner, an occasional DJ and juggler, and caffeine
            addict.
          </p>
          <p>

            me, go right ahead, contact me!
